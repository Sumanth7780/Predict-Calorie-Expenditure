End-to-End Project Plan
1. Data Understanding & EDA
Load train/test datasets.

Identify feature types (categorical, numerical, time-related, etc.).

Visualize distributions (e.g., boxplots, histograms for Calories).

Explore correlation with target variable.

Detect outliers and missing values.

2. Feature Engineering
Create new features: e.g., time-based, BMI if height/weight exists, interaction terms.

Encode categorical variables (OneHot, Label, Target encoding).

Normalize or standardize numerical features.

Use PCA or autoencoders to reduce dimensions if needed.

3. Baseline Models
Start with:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

Compare performance on validation set using RMSLE.

4. Advanced Deep Learning Models
Build a feedforward neural network (DNN) using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

Try TabNet or SAINT (Self-Attention for Tabular) for performance boost.

Include dropout, batch normalization, and tuning learning rate schedulers.

5. Model Evaluation
Use K-Fold Cross Validation for robustness.

Plot feature importance (SHAP, Permutation).

Tune hyperparameters with Optuna or GridSearchCV.

6. Submission & Ensembling
Blend top 2â€“3 models (e.g., weighted average or stacking).

Format predictions to id,Calories and save as .csv.
